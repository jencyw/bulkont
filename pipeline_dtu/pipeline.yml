# This is a downstream analysis for differential transcript usage analysis, using R package DRIMSeq and stageR
# The input count matrix of transcripts is generated from Bambu R package
# The output files of this anlysis are in the "DTU_DRIMSeq.dir", including the spreadsheets of genes (res, sig,and statistics after stageR),plots of genes significant in DTU  

# Please check the requirement before initiate the pipeline

#Requirement: 

### Load R: module load R-cbrg/

### Availability of the required R packages

### The following two spreadsheets in the work directory 
# 1. count matrix: counts_transcript.txt 
# 2. sample_sheet.csv:
#      two essential columns:  sample_id and condition
# 

annotation: "gencode.v44.annotation.sqlite"
txp_info: "Homo_sapiens_Ensembl110.tsv"
gtf: "Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.110.chr_patch_hapl_scaff.gtf.tsv"

# the treatment group for the comparison with the control group (same input name as in the column "condition") 

control: [control group]
treatment: [treatment group]

# Parameter for DRIMSeq filtering
min_samps_feature_expr: 1
min_feature_expr: 3
min_samps_gene_expr: 3
min_gene_expr: 10

# threshold for the output of significant genes and the related plots
